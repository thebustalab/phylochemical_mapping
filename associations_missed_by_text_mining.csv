The Crystal Structures of Zea mays and Arabidopsis 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase,"Iris M. Fritze, Lars Linden, Jörg Freigang, Günter Auerbach, Robert Huber, Stefan Steinbacher","The transformation of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate, catalyzed by 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), plays an important role in degrading aromatic amino acids. As the reaction product homogentisate serves as aromatic precursor for prenylquinone synthesis in plants, the enzyme is an interesting target for herbicides. In this study we report the first x-ray structures of the plant HPPDs of Zea mays and Arabidopsis in their substrate-free form at 2.0 Å and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively. Previous biochemical characterizations have demonstrated that eukaryotic enzymes behave as homodimers in contrast to prokaryotic HPPDs, which are homotetramers. Plant and bacterial enzymes share the overall fold but use orthogonal surfaces for oligomerization. In addition, comparison of both structures provides direct evidence that the C-terminal helix gates substrate access to the active site around a nonheme ferrous iron center. In the Z. mays HPPD structure this helix packs into the active site, sequestering it completely from the solvent. In contrast, in the Arabidopsis structure this helix tilted by about 60° into the solvent and leaves the active site fully accessible. By elucidating the structure of plant HPPD enzymes we aim to provide a structural basis for the development of new herbicides",Plant Physiology,Zea mays,Poales,Poaceae,4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate,,T,,,Arabidopsis thaliana,HPPD,-,N,N
Prephenate aminotransferase directs plant phenylalanine biosynthesis via arogenate,"Hiroshi Maeda, Heejin Yoo & Natalia Dudareva ","The aromatic amino acids L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine and their plant-derived natural products are essential in human and plant metabolism and physiology. Here we identified Petunia hybrida and Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding prephenate aminotransferases (PPA-ATs), thus completing the identification of the genes involved in phenylalanine and tyrosine biosyntheses. Biochemical and genetic characterization of enzymes showed that PPA-AT directs carbon flux from prephenate toward arogenate, making the arogenate pathway predominant in plant phenylalanine biosynthesis.",Nature Chemical Biology,Petunia hybrida,Solanales,Solanaceae,4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate,,T,,,Arabidopsis thaliana,"Phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan,  prephenate, arogenate, shikimate",Petals,N,N

Dhammika Nanayakkar, Franck E.Dayana","The lichen secondary metabolite usnic acid exists as a (−) and a (+) enantiomer, indicating a α or β projection of the methyl group at position 9b, respectively. (−)-Usnic caused a dose-dependent bleaching of the cotyledonary tissues associated with a decrease of both chlorophylls and carotenoids in treated plants whereas no bleaching was observed with the (+) enantiomer. (−)-Usnic acid inhibited protophorphyrinogen oxidase activity (I50=3 μM), but did not lead to protoporphyrin IX accumulation. Bleaching appears to be caused by irreversible inhibition of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase by (−)-usnic acid (apparent IC50=50 nM).",FEBS Letters,Arabidopsis thaliana,Brassicales,Brassicaceae,4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate,,T,,,,-,Seedlings,Y,N
Enzymology of l-Tyrosine Biosynthesis in Mung Bean (Vigna radiata [L.] Wilczek),"Judith L. Rubin, Roy A. Jensen","The enzymes of the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (prephenate dehydrogenase and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate aminotransferase) and pretyrosine (prephenate aminotransferase and pretyrosine dehydrogenase) pathways of l-tyrosine biosynthesis were partially purified from mung bean (Vigna radiata [L.] Wilczek) seedlings. NADP-dependent prephenate dehydrogenase and pretyrosine dehydrogenase activities coeluted from ion exchange, adsorption, and gel-filtration columns, suggesting that a single protein (52,000 daltons) catalyzes both reactions. The ratio of the activities of partially purified prephenate to pretyrosine dehydrogenase was constant during all purification steps as well as after partial inactivation caused by p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid or heat. The activity of prephenate dehydrogenase, but not of pretyrosine dehydrogenase, was inhibited by l-tyrosine at nonsaturating levels of substrate. The Km values for prephenate and pretyrosine were similar, but the specific activity with prephenate was 2.9 times greater than with pretyrosine.",,Vigna radiata,Fabales,Fabaceae,4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate,,T,,,,-,Seeds,Y,N
Tocopherol content and activities of tyrosine aminotransferase and cystine lyase in Arabidopsis under stress conditions,"Heike Holländer-Czytko, Janine Grabowski, Iris Sandorf, Katrin Weckermann, Elmar W. Weiler","Tocopherols are presumed to be important antioxidants and scavengers of lipid radicals and reactive oxygen species in plants. Age is known to be a condition under which oxidative stress increases. In leaves of aging Arabidopsis thaliana plants, the content of α-tocopherol as well as of γ-tocopherol increased significantly. The activity of tyrosine aminotransferase, which supplies the biosynthetic pathway with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, was increased as well. On the other hand, coronatine, a phytotoxin mimicking octadecanoids and leading to symptoms of senescence, caused a moderate increase in α-tocopherol as well as some enhancement of γ-tocopherol.",,Arabidopsis thaliana,Brassicales,Brassicaceae,4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate,,T,,,,-,Leaf material,N,N
Characterization of aromatic aminotransferases from Ephedra sinica Stapf,"Korey Kilpatrick, Agnieszka Pajak2, Jillian M. Hagel, Mark W. Sumarah, Efraim Lewinsohn, Peter J. Facchini, Frédéric Marsolais","Ephedra sinica Stapf (Ephedraceae) is a broom-like shrub cultivated in arid regions of China, Korea and Japan. This plant accumulates large amounts of the ephedrine alkaloids in its aerial tissues. These analogs of amphetamine mimic the actions of adrenaline and stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. While much is known about their pharmacological properties, the mechanisms by which they are synthesized remain largely unknown. A functional genomics platform was established to investigate their biosynthesis. Candidate enzymes were obtained from an expressed sequence tag collection based on similarity to characterized enzymes with similar functions. Two aromatic aminotransferases, EsAroAT1 and EsAroAT2, were characterized. The results of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that both genes are expressed in young stem tissue, where ephedrine alkaloids are synthesized, and in mature stem tissue.",,Ephedra sinica,Ephedrales,Ephedraceae,4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate,,T,,,,-,Stems,Y,N

Biochemical evaluation of a parsley tyrosine decarboxylase results in a novel 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde synthase enzyme,"Michael P. Torrens-Spencea, Glenda Gillaspya, Bingyu Zhaob, Kim Haricha, Robert H. Whitea, Jianyong Lia","Plant aromatic amino acid decarboxylases (AAADs) are effectively indistinguishable from plant aromatic acetaldehyde syntheses (AASs) through primary sequence comparison. Spectroscopic analyses of several characterized AASs and AAADs were performed to look for absorbance spectral identifiers. Although this limited survey proved inconclusive, the resulting work enabled the reevaluation of several characterized plant AAS and AAAD enzymes. Upon completion, a previously reported parsley AAAD protein was demonstrated to have AAS activity. Substrate specificity tests demonstrate that this novel AAS enzyme has a unique substrate specificity towards tyrosine (km 0.46 mM) and dopa (km 1.40 mM). Metabolite analysis established the abundance of tyrosine and absence of dopa in parsley extracts. Such analysis indicates that tyrosine is likely to be the sole physiological substrate. The resulting information suggests that this gene is responsible for the in vivo production of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). This is the first reported case of an AAS enzyme utilizing tyrosine as a primary substrate and the first report of a single enzyme capable of producing 4-HPAA from tyrosine.",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,Petroselinum crispum,Apiales,Apiaceae,4-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde,,T,,,None,,Whole plant,N,N
"Production of three phenylethanoids, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and salidroside, using plant genes expressing in Escherichia coli","Daeun Chung, So Yeon Kim & Joong-Hoon Ahn ","Salidroside and its aglycone tyrosol are important compounds found in Rhodiola plants. In this study, callus derived from Rhodiola crenulata was induced and grown when explants were incubated on a Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing various concentrations of 6-benzyaldenine (BA), naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and thidiazuron (TDZ). Callus was easily initiated from juvenile leaves in half strength MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/L BA and 3.0 mg/L NAA, while full strength MS containing 0.5 mg/L TDZ and 0.5 mg/L NAA was the best for callus subculture and subsequent cell suspension culture. The activities of L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and β-D-glucosidase, two key enzymes in salidroside synthesis, increased at first and subsequently decreased in cell suspension cultures. The salidroside and tyrosol levels in the cell suspension cultures were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. High levels of salidroside and tyrosol were detected in cell suspension cultures of R. crenulata extracted with 75 % methanol, demonstrating that the biotechnological production of these compounds using plant cell suspension cultures derived from R. crenulata may be an attractive alternative to harvest-based production.","Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (PCTOC)",Rhodiola sachalinensis,Saxifragales,Crassulaceae,Tyrosol,,T,,,None,,Seed culture,Y,N

Activity of tyrosol glucosyltransferase and improved salidroside production through biotransformation of tyrosol in Rhodiola sachalinensis cell cultures,"J.FXua, Z.G Sua, P.S Fengb","The activity of tyrosol glucosyltransferase (TGase) of Rhodiola sachalinensis cells was found to be the highest at the exponential growth phase while the intracellular tyrosol accumulated in large amounts at the stationary growth phase. This non-synchronization of the TGase activity with the tyrosol accumulation was responsible for the low yield of salidroside obtained in cell suspension cultures. When 1 mmol l−1 exogenous tyrosol was added to the culture at day 8 and subsequently incubated for 24 h, nearly 95% of the added tyrosol was transformed to salidroside. The optimal concentration of exogenous tyrosol for the glucosylation reaction was 3 mmol l−1. Excess high concentration of tyrosol was toxic to cell growth and inhibited the biotransformation reaction. By repeated addition of 3 mmol l−1 tyrosol at 24 h intervals over 3 d, very high salidroside yield of 516 μmol g−1 (15.4% of dry weight) was obtained.",Journal of Biotechnology,Rhodiola sachalinensis,Saxifragales,Crassulaceae,Tyrosol,,T,,,None,,Stem segments,Y,N
Simultaneous determination of salidroside and tyrosol in extracts of Rhodiola L. by microwave assisted extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography,"Yu Maoa, Yan Lib, Ning Yaob","Rhodiola L. has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and has shown great promise in recent clinical trials.

The optimized method provided satisfactory precision (R.S.D. values less than 7.5%), good recovery (from 94.4 to 123%), and good linear relation in the range of 5.0–500 μg/mL for salidroside and 1.0–100 μg/mL for tyrosol (R2 > 0.999). The proposed method was applied to quantitative analysis of salidroside and tyrosol in Rhodiola L. samples from five different growing areas. To demonstrate the method feasibility, recirculation was also used to analyze salidroside and tyrosol in Rhodiola L. samples. The proposed MAE–HPLC–DAD is a simple, rapid and low-cost method for quantitative analysis of salidroside and tyrosol, and a potential tool for quality assessment of Rhodiola L. sample.",Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis,Rhodiola L,Saxifragales,Crassulaceae,Tyrosol,,T,,,None,,Dried root,Y,N
Enhancement of phenolic compounds in olive plants (Olea europaea L.) and their influence on resistance against Phytophthora sp.,"J.A. Del Rı́oa, A.G. Báideza, J.M. Botı́ab, A. Ortuñoa","The total phenol levels in different olive organs and tissues are studied. The HPLC-MS studies point to the presence of oleuropein, catechin and tyrosol as some of the main phenolic compounds in these extracts. The effect of Brotomax treatment on phenolic compound levels in this plant and the possible role of these compounds as antifungal agents against Phytophthora sp. are also studied. An increase in the total phenol content of leaves and stems was observed 120 days after treatment with 0.3% Brotomax. The cortex was the stem tissue which showed the greatest accumulation of these secondary compounds. An in vitro study of the inhibitory effect of these compounds on fungal growth revealed that tyrosol was the most active agent, followed by catechin and oleuropein, their fungitoxic effect being greater when they acted synergically.",Food Chemistry,Olea europaea L. cv.,Lamiales,Oleaceae,Tyrosol,,T,,,None,,"HPLC-MS/leaves, stems & roots",Y,N
Bioactivity-guided Isolation of Antiosteoporotic Compounds From Ligustrum Lucidum,"Qianfeng Chen, Lijuan Yang, Guolin Zhang, Fei Wang","The fruits of Ligustrum lucidum (FLL) has long been used for the treatment of osteoporosis in China, but the antiosteoporotic compounds in FLL are still poorly understood. In this study, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity-guided isolation of osteogenic components from FLL was carried out by using osteoblast-like UMR-106 cells. Eight compounds, namely tyrosol (1), tyrosyl acetate (2), hydroxytyrosol (3), salidroside (4), oleoside dimethyl ester (5), oleoside-7-ethyl-11-methyl ester (6), nuzhenide (7), and G13 (8), were isolated and identified. Further study showed that compounds 3, 4, 7, and 8 increased ALP activity in UMR-106 cells. Compounds 5, 6, and 7 promoted the proliferation of UMR-106 cells. The aqueous extract of FLL-activated ERα/β-mediated gene transcription, whereas the isolated compounds were inactive. All eight isolated compounds also exhibited antioxidative activity, with compounds 1, 2, and 3 being the most potent. These results indicate that the antiosteoporotic effect of FLL is derived from different compounds together with different mechanisms such as ER-dependent or independent pathways and antioxidative effects.

Galantamine, a representative alkaloid of Amaryllidaceae plants, including L. radiata, exhibits selective and dominant acetylcholinesterase inhibition. In spite of the economic and officinal importance of L. radiata, the molecular biological and biochemical information on L. radiata is relatively deficient. Therefore, this study provides functional information of L. radiata, describe galantamine biosynthesis in the various organs, and provide transcriptomic and metabolic datasets to support elucidation of galantamine biosynthesis pathway in future studies. The results of studies conducted in duplicate revealed the presence of a total of 325,609 and 404,019 unigenes, acquired from 9,913,869,968 and 10,162,653,038 raw reads, respectively, after trimming the raw reads using CutAdapt, assembly using Trinity package, and clustering using CD-Hit-EST. All of the assembled unigenes were aligned to the public databases, including National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein (NR) and nucleotide (Nt) database, SWISS-PROT (UniProt) protein sequence data bank, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), the Swiss-Prot protein database, Gene Ontology (GO), and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database to predict potential genes and provide their functional information. Based on our transcriptome data and published literatures, eight full-length cDNA clones encoding LrPAL2, LrPAL3, LrC4H2, LrC3H, LrTYDC2, LrNNR, LrN4OMT, and LrCYP96T genes, involved in galantamine biosynthesis, were identified in L. radiata. In order to investigate galantamine biosynthesis in different plant parts of L. radiata grown in a growth chamber, gene expression levels were measured through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis using these identified genes and galantamine levels were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The qRT-PCR data revealed high expression levels of LrNNR, LrN4OMT, and LrCYP96T in the bulbs, and, as expected, we observed higher amounts of galantamine in the bulbs than in the root and leaves. Additionally, a total of 40 hydrophilic metabolites were detected in the different organs using gas-chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Expression Levels of Galantamine Biosynthetic Genes and Galantamine Accumulation in the Different Organs of Lycoris radiata,"Chang Ha Park, Ye Eun Park and Sang Un Park","Background : Lycoris radiata belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is a bulbous plant native to South Korea, China, and Japan. Galantamine, a representative alkaloid of Amaryllidaceae plants, including L. radiata, exhibits selective and dominant acetylcholinesterase inhibition. In this study, transcriptome analysis of L. radiata was performed. Methods and Results : Genes for galantamine biosynthesis were used to design primers for qRT-PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with LrActin as a reference gene for normalization. The RT-PCR results reveal the expression of LrPAL A and LrC4H at an early stage in the pathway. Interestingly, the expression of these genes was significantly higher in roots. However, the expression levels of LrNNR and LrN4OMT, which are closely involved in galantamine biosynthesis, were significantly higher in bulbs than leaves and roots. The expression levels of LrPAL B, LrTYDC, LrCYP98A3 and LrCYP76T were not significantly different among the different parts of the plants tested. HPLC analysis confirmed the presence of galantamine in all the organs, including the root (0.53 ± 0.07 ㎎/g dry weight), bulb (0.27 ± 0.04 ㎎/g dry weight), and leaf (0.75 ± 0.09 ㎎/g dry weight). The galantamine level in the bulb was 1.42 and 2.78 times higher than that in the root and leaf, respectively. The results of qRT-PCR for the eight galantamine genes revealed relatively high levels of genes expressed early, including LrPAL A, LrPAL B, LrC4H, and LrTYDC in the roots. However, in the bulbs, the levels of LrNNR and LrN4OMT were higher, which are crucial for galantamine biosynthesis. It also explains why bulbs contain high amounts of galantamine, which is likely due to the increased expression of LrNNR and LrN4OMT and the high levels of LrCYP96T, although the genes expressed early were expressed at high levels in the root. Conclusion : Transcript data of plants grown in a growth chamber revealed high expression levels of LrNNR and LrN4OMT genes that are closely involved in galantamine biosynthesis, and, as expected, we observed higher amounts of galantamine in the bulbs than in the root and leaves.",The Korean Society of Medicinal Crop Science,Lycoris radiata,Asparagales,Amaryllidaceae,Galanthamine,,F,No title with these species are listes,"Quantification: HPLC, mg/g dry weight",-,,"bulbs, root, leaves",Y,N

Chernetskyy &M. Waksmundzka-Hajnos","Retention parameters of galantamine and lycorine standards were determined on different columns, i.e., octadecyl silica, SM C18, and strong cation-exchange (SCX) columns with different aqueous mobile phases. Retention of alkaloids was investigated on C18, SM C18 columns with mobile phase containing 5% MeCN, 20% acetate buffer at pH 3.5, and 0.025 ML−1 diethylamine (DEA), and on SCX column with mobile phase containing 8% MeCN and phosphate buffer at pH 2.5.

GALANTAMINE CONTENT IN LEUCOJUM AESTIVUM POPULATIONS GROWN IN NORTHWEST ALBANIA,"Rilinda Klosi, Mersin Mersinllari, Eva Gavani","Although chemical synthesis of galantamine is feasible, plants are still the main sources of production for this natural product. Galantamine, a reversible acethylcholinesterase inhibitor, has been used for decades for various medicinal purposes. More recently, it has been successfully applied to the treatment of symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. Generally, sources for galantamine isolation are the plants of Amaryllidaceae family, usually from the Leucojum and Narcissus genus. The bulbs of Leucojum aestivum L., known in Albania as “zambaku i kënetës” or “bilbilbardha”, are used for galantamine isolation. Leucojum is included in the IUCN Red List of endangered species. It is known for the diversity of alkaloid fraction, dependent on genotype and geographical position. Our study aims to investigate alkaloid fraction, with a focus on the galantamine content in the bulbs of Leucojum aestivum L. populations, grown near the Buna river banks. The samples were collected during two different periods of vegetation: bloom and fructification. Thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography were the analytical techniques used for the qualitative and quantitative determination. The number of alkaloids detected in different bulb extracts was eight, with galantamine as the dominant compound. The linearity of HPLC method was checked by injecting solutions containing 20 up to 320 µg/ml of galantamine. The average galantamine content was found to be respectively 0.13% and 0.14% for samples M1 and M2, with reference to the dried material.",Albanian Journal of Pharmaceutical,Leucojum aestivum L,Asparagales,Amaryllidaceae,Galanthamine,,F,No title with these species are listes,"Quantification: HPLC, mg/g dry weight",,,bulbs,Y,N

Galanthamine production in tissue culture and metabolomic study on Amaryllidaceae alkaloids in Narcissus pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton,"Aleya Ferdausia, Xianmin Chang, Anthony Hall, Meriel Jones","The Amaryllidaceae alkaloids e.g. galanthamine (Gal), lycorine and narciclasine are noted for their pharmaceutical properties. Gal is a long acting, selective, and competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for the treatment of early to mid-stage Alzheimer's diseases. The biosynthesis of alkaloids by plants using in vitro systems has been considered as a tool for drug discovery and production since total chemical synthesis is not economic. The biosynthetic pathways, especially for Gal, are starting to be understood, but still far from complete. This study is emphasised on the yield from whole plant and developing cell culture systems for optimized alkaloid production. In vitro cultures of Narcissus pseudonarcissus (cv. Carlton) initiated from twin-scale explants cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar medium fortified with different concentrations of growth regulators, were screened for their ability to produce alkaloids through GC–MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry). Callus obtained mainly from the MS medium containing high concentration of auxins i.e. 20 mg/l NAA (naphthalene acetic acid), while media with low auxin (4 mg/l NAA) and MS basal medium gave bulblets with both white and green shoots. Regenerated bulblets developed from callus found in both high and low auxin MS media. Tissue culture derived materials (callus and bulblets) and field grown samples (bulb, basal plate and leaves) from 'Carlton' were analyzed for galanthamine content. The highest amount of galanthamine was obtained from basal plate tissue followed by bulb tissues, leaves, bulblets with green shoots, bulblets with white shoots and regenerated bulblets. Trace amount of galanthamine was found in callus. An NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) based metabolomic analysis showed that the relative concentrations of compounds involved in phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, the initial stage biosynthetic pathways that yield the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, were higher in field samples than in vitro samples which support the GC–MS findings of high Gal production in field samples.",Industrial Crops and Products,Narcissus pseudonarcissus,Asparagales,Amaryllidaceae,Galanthamine,,T,Title not available in lukes list,"Quantification: GCMS, ug/g DW",-,,"bulbs, bulblets",Y,N

[Salidroside Biosynthesis Pathway: The Initial Reaction and Glycosylation of Tyrosol],"Lanqing Ma 1, Chunmei Liu, Hansong Yu, Jixing Zhang, Dongyao Gao, Yanfang Li, Younian Wang","Salidroside, the 8-O-beta-D-glucoside of tyrosol, is a novel adaptogenic drug extracted from the medicinal plant Rhodiola sachalinensis A. Bor. Due to the scarcity of R. sachalinensis and its low yield of salidroside, there is great interest in enhancing the production of salidroside by biotechnological process. Glucosylation of tyrosol is thought to be the final step in salidroside biosynthesis. In our related works, three UGT clones were isolated from the roots and the cultured cells. Our intention was to combine the catalytic specificity of these UGTs in vitro in order to change the level of salidroside in vivo by over-expression of the above UGTs. However, as the aglycone substrate of salidroside, the biosynthetic pathway of tyrosol and its regulation are less well understood. The results of related studies revealed that there are two different possibilities for the tyrosol biosynthetic pathway. One possibility is that tyrosol is produced from a p-coumaric acid precursor, which is derived mainly from phenylalanine. The second possibility is that the precursor of tyrosol might be tyramine, which is synthesized from tyrosine. Our previous work demonstrated that over-expression of the endogenous phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene (PALrs1) and accumulation of p-coumaric acid did not facilitate tyrosol biosynthesis. In contrast, the data presented in our recent work provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that the tyrosine decarboxylase (RsTyrDC) is most likely to have an important function in the initial reaction of the salidroside biosynthesis pathway in R. Sachalinensis.",National Library of Medicine,Rhodiola sachalinensis A. Bor,Saxifragales,Crassulaceae,Tyrosol,,T,,,None,,-,N,N
A Novel UDP-Glycosyltransferase of Rhodiola crenulata Converts Tyrosol to Specifically Produce Icariside D2,"Zhihua Liao ,1,2 Fei Qiu ,2 Junlan Zeng ,2 Li Gu ,1 Bangjun Wang,2 Xiaozhong Lan  ,1 and Min Chen  3","Rhodiola crenulata is a Tibetan native herbal plant belonging to the family of Crassulaceae, which produces the pharmaceutical icariside D2 with the activities of inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme and killing leukemia cancer cells. In this study, we functionally characterized a novel UDP-glycosyltransferase (RcUGT1) that converted tyrosol to specifically produce icariside D2 from R. crenulata at molecular and biochemical levels. RcUGT1 was highly expressed in flowers and roots, while the icariside D2 content was much higher in stems than that in other organs, suggesting the potential translocation of icariside D2 from flowers and roots to stems. The high production of icariside D2 in stems provided a reasonable suggestion to farmers to harvest stems instead of roots for icariside D2 production. Enzymatic assays of recombinant RcUGT1 indicated that it converted tyrosol to specifically form icariside D2, with the values of Km 0.97±0.10 mM, Vmax 286±8.26 pKat/mg, Kcat 0.01552 s−1, and Kcat/Km 159.55 s−1 M−1.

It is well known that glucosylation of tyrosol is the final step in the biosynthesis of salidroside; however, the biosynthetic pathway of tyrosol and its regulation are less well understood. A summary of the results of related studies revealed that the precursor of tyrosol might be tyramine, which is synthesized from tyrosine. In this study, a cDNA clone encoding tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC) was isolated from Rhodiola sachalinensis A. Bor using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The resulting cDNA was designated RsTyrDC. RNA gel–blot analysis revealed that the predominant sites of expression in plants are the roots and high levels of transcripts are also found in callus tissue culture. Functional analysis revealed that tyrosine was best substrate of recombinant RsTyrDC. The over-expression of the sense-RsTyrDC resulted in a marked increase of tyrosol and salidroside content, but the levels of tyrosol and salidroside were 274 and 412%, respectively, lower in the antisense-RsTyrDC transformed lines than those in the controls.

Analysis of selected Crinum species for galanthamine alkaloid: an anti-Alzheimer drug,"U. B. Jagtap, M. M. Lekhak, D. P. Fulzele, S. R. Yadav and V. A. Bapat","Galanthamine, an isoquinoline alkaloid and the current drug of choice for treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer disease, is mainly obtained from Amaryllidaceae members. At present, the production of galanthamine from available natural plant sources is not sufficient to meet the demands of pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, overexploitation of the plant material leads to the depletion of available natural wild populations. Therefore, there is a need to explore additional natural sources for the extraction of this drug. Thus the aim of this study is to determine galanthamine content in five Indian Crinum species. The bulbs of each Crinum species were extracted with methanol. Extracts were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The chromatographic separation was performed using an isocratic system with a mobile phase of methanol : 5 mM (NH4)2HPO4 (55:45 v/v) applied at a flow rate 0.8 ml/min using a UV detector at 288 nm.

Cloning and Characterization of a Norbelladine 49-O-Methyltransferase Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Alzheimer’s Drug Galanthamine in Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus,"Matthew B. Kilgore, Megan M. Augustin, Courtney M. Starks, Mark O’Neil-Johnson, Gregory D. May, John A. Crow, Toni M. Kutchan","Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. This compound is primarily isolated from daffodil (Narcissus spp.), snowdrop (Galanthus spp.), and summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum). Despite its importance as a medicine, no genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of galanthamine have been identified. This absence of genetic information on biosynthetic pathways is a limiting factor in the development of synthetic biology platforms for many important botanical medicines. The paucity of information is largely due to the limitations of traditional methods for finding biochemical pathway enzymes and genes in non-model organisms. A new bioinformatic approach using several recent technological improvements was applied to search for genes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway, first targeting methyltransferases due to strong signature amino acid sequences in the proteins. Using Illumina sequencing, a de novo transcriptome assembly was constructed for daffodil. BLAST was used to identify sequences that contain signatures for plant O-methyltransferases in this transcriptome. The program HAYSTACK was then used to identify methyltransferases that fit a model for galanthamine biosynthesis in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues. One candidate gene for the methylation of norbelladine to 4′-O-methylnorbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway was identified. This methyltransferase cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the protein purified by affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was found to be a norbelladine 4′-O-methyltransferase (NpN4OMT) of the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway.",PLOS,Narcissus pseudonarcissus,Asparagales,Amaryllidaceae,Galanthamine,,T,,,"Narcissus spp., Galanthus spp., Leucojum aestivum",,"leaf, bulb, influorescences",N,N

An initial study tested an innovative approach for producing daffodil-derived galanthamine based on integrating daffodil growing into existing marginal pasture; avoiding the need to plough the land. Experimental lines of daffodils were established under upland permanent pasture. Over 80% of bulbs successfully established at each site. There was no effect of planting site or planting density on galanthamine concentrations within vegetative tissues, which were higher than anticipated. The results confirm that planting daffodils under grass in upland areas could offer a novel and sustainable source of plant-derived galanthamine.

Secondary metabolism in cultured red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cells: Differential regulation of betaxanthin and betacyanin biosynthesis,Pierre-Alain Girod & Jean-Pierre Zryd,"Red beet cell lines exhibiting a range of cell colours were generated from secondary callus via specific induction methods. Phenotype colour ranged from white/green through yellow, orange and red to deep violet, representing all types of pigments found in red beet plant. Specific phenotypes could only be obtained through specific induction sequences and once established were stabilised by cultivation on a maintenance medium. The ratio of auxin (2, 4-D) to cytokinin (6-BAP) was an important factor in the control of these processes. All coloured phenotypes were linked, but could be classified into two main groups, one yellow-red and the other orange-violet, according to their different cellular morphologies. A certain amount of instability still existed within each group. Modification of the growth regulator composition could be used to interchange specific combinations of coloured phenotypes, depending upon the initial state of cellular differentiation. Use of the DNA-methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine demonstrated that methylation plays a key role in the repression of genes encoding enzymes involved in betacyanin biosynthesis.

New insights in the allelopathic traits of different barley genotypes: Middle Eastern and Tibetan wild-relative accessions vs. cultivated modern barley,"Mauro Maver ,Begoña Miras-Moreno,Luigi Lucini,Marco Trevisan,Youry Pii,Stefano Cesco,Tanja Mimmo","The two alkaloids gramine and hordenine have been known for playing a role in the allelopathic ability in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). These allelochemicals can be both found in leaves and roots in some barley cultivars whereas in others one seems to exclude the other. In this study eighteen accessions of barley from the Middle-East area, one accession from Tibet and the modern spring cultivar Barke, already used as parental donor in a nested associated mapping (NAM) population, were screened for their gramine, hordenine and N-Methyltyramine (the direct precursor of hordenine) content in leaves, roots and exudates. Moreover, the toxicity of the three allelochemicals on root growth inhibition on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) was evaluated. Results of this study showed the preferential production of gramine and hordenine in leaves and roots, respectively, in the nineteen barley accessions. On the other hand, in the modern barley cultivar Barke, the highest content of hordenine in roots and the general lack of gramine suggests a favored biosynthesis of the former. Gramine was not detected in the root exudates. In additions, different metabolomic profiles were observed in wild relatives compared to modern barley genotypes. The results also showed the phytotoxic effects of the three compounds on root growth of lettuce seedlings, with a reduction in root length and an increase of root surface area and diameter.

Secondary metabolites during early development in plants,Iva´n De-la-Cruz Chaco´n • Christian Anabi Riley-Saldan˜a • Alma Rosa Gonza´lez-Esquinca,"Early development is a critical stage in a plant’s life, as the plant must establish itself in the ecosystem during this period. The secondary metabolites (SM) during this phase is a strategy that contributes to the survival of plant species. Through a review of the literature, a number of reports were found that investigated the presence of SM during germination and early plant development (phases 0 and 1 according to the Zadoks and BBCH scales). A total of 250 reports were found that investigated 99 species and nearly 200 SM that accumulate during this period of the plant life cycle. A large portion of the SM are biosynthesised de novo, whereas the remainder are derived in part or in total from the mother plant. In many cases, the resources for biosynthesis are supplied only by the reserve material of the endosperm or cotyledons, which allows for independent photosynthesis. The presence of SM at these stages confers characteristics of more advanced stages, such as tissue-specific distribution, spatio-temporal regulation, and the individual regulation of all of the biosynthesised SM. The amount and diversity of SM are not universally related to the progress of plant development, but it is a widespread phenomenon. The early production of SM has ecological implications that involve defence mechanisms, relationships with microorganisms, and the role of these compounds as nitrogen reserves. This review contributes to the systematisation of studies on SM in the early stages of development.",Phytochemistry,Hordeum vulgare ,Poales,Poaceae,Hordenine,,T,,,None,"N‐methyltyramine, gramine",-,N,N

In our chemical investigations on authenticated A. rigidula plant material, we established a rapid and sensitive LC–MS/MS method for the quantitative determination of several phenethylamine, tyramine and tryptamine derivatives. Stable isotopically labeled compounds were used as internal standards for quantitative analysis. We found total calculated contents of 6 biogenic amines in A. rigidula leaf of 18.6 and 32.9 μg/g. The content of selected amines in 21 dietary supplements labeled as containing A. rigidula was determined by a second LC–MS/MS method. Our study revealed significant differences in the amine profiles of authenticated plant materials and dietary supplements. β-Methylphenethylamine, a non-natural compound, was found in 9 of the 21 dietary supplement products. β-Methylphenethylamine was found at levels of 960–60,500 μg/g while phenethylamine was found at levels of 710–171,620 μg/g. β-Methylphenethylamine is a positional isomer of amphetamine and our results showed that it can be misidentified as amphetamine during LC–MS analysis. An independent GC–MS analysis was used to confirm the presence of β-methylphenethylamine and the absence of amphetamine in dietary supplements labeled as containing A. rigidula.

BIOGENESIS OF ALKALOIDS: XVIII. THE FORMATION OF HORDENINE FROM PHENYLALANINE IN BARLEY,Jaques Massicot and Léo Marion,"When phenylalanine-2-C14 was fed to sprouting barley the hordenine isolated from the plant was radioactive. The activity in the hordenine was shown by degradation of the alkaloid to be located on the carbon of the side chain β to the aromatic ring. A fraction of the fatty acids present in the roots was more strongly radioactive than the hordenine and must have arisen by the breakdown of the amino acid. The gramine isolated from the shoots was inert. Phenylalanine does not take part in the synthesis of gramine, but it is a precursor of hordenine and, hence, must be converted to tyrosine in barley.

The ratio of alkaloid concentration between mature plant and morphologically undifferentiated cells of callous tissue was 1:1.7. A relationship between culture medium containing tyrosine and alkaloid production was also observed in the callous tissues of C. peruvianus.

Characterisation of betalain biosynthesis in Parakeelya flowers identifies the key biosynthetic gene DOD as belonging to an expanded LigB gene family that is conserved in betalain-producing species,"Hsiao-Hang Chung1†, Kathy E.

Harrison1†","Plant betalain pigments are intriguing because they are restricted to the Caryophyllales and are mutually exclusive with the more common anthocyanins. However, betalain biosynthesis is poorly understood compared to that of anthocyanins. In this study, betalain production and betalain-related genes were characterized in Parakeelya mirabilis (Montiaceae). RT-PCR and transcriptomics identified three sequences related to the key biosynthetic enzyme Dopa 4,5-dioxgenase (DOD). In addition to a LigB gene similar to that of non-Caryophyllales species (Class I genes), two other P. mirabilis LigB genes were found (DOD and DOD-like, termed Class II). PmDOD and PmDOD-like had 70% amino acid identity. Only PmDOD was implicated in betalain synthesis based on transient assays of enzyme activity and correlation of transcript abundance to spatio-temporal betalain accumulation. The role of PmDOD-like remains unknown. The striking pigment patterning of the flowers was due to distinct zones of red betacyanin and yellow betaxanthin production. The major betacyanin was the unglycosylated betanidin rather than the commonly found glycosides, an occurrence for which there are a few previous reports. The white petal zones lacked pigment but had DOD activity suggesting alternate regulation of the pathway in this tissue. DOD and DOD-like sequences were also identified in other betalain-producing species but not in examples of anthocyanin-producing Caryophyllales or non-Caryophyllales species. A Class I LigB sequence from the anthocyanin-producing Caryophyllaceae species Dianthus superbus and two DOD-like sequences from the Amaranthaceae species Beta vulgaris and Ptilotus spp. did not show DOD activity in the transient assay. The additional sequences suggests that DOD is part of a larger LigB gene family in betalain-producing Caryophyllales taxa, and the tandem genomic arrangement of two of the three B. vulgaris LigB genes suggests the involvement of duplication in the gene family evolution.",Frontiers in Plant Science,Parakeelya mirabilis,Caryophyllales,Montiaceae,Dopaxanthin,,T,,,-,"vulgaxanthin I, vulgaxanthin II, portulacaxanthin II",Petals,N,N

Chapter 17 - Analysis of betalains (betacyanins and betaxanthins),Ericsson Coy-Barrera,"Betalains are nitrogen-containing specialized (secondary) metabolites and natural water-soluble pigments (also recognized as chromoalkaloids). These pigments are divided into two main structural groups, betacyanins and betaxanthins, featured by red-violet and yellow-orange colorations, respectively. Several sources of betalains remain to be explored, representing an area of opportunity within the research on natural colorants. These pigments are described to have a significant free-radical scavenging activity, but they also exhibited positive influence on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and metabolic disorders as well as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive effects. These biological properties are well-complemented by additional benefits related to the lacking of allergic responses, toxicity, and/or mutagenic effects. Betalains can be appropriately extracted using conventional acidic maceration (pH 5), but also through emergent protocols using ultrasound, microwave, membranes, two-phase systems, among others, with good-to-excellent results. Once betalains are extracted, they can also be analyzed/characterized using several analytical techniques such as ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and/or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the sensitivity and stability still being the main challenge. However, collaborative, systematic studies on enhancing the stability and bioavailability of betalains are required to promote/ensure further advances on betalains applications. Hence, this chapter compiled information on betalains, comprising phytochemistry, medicinal/biological properties, extraction, analysis, contents, and applications, as an effort to provide a reference material for further studies on betalains.",Recent Advances in Natural Products Analysis,Portulaca grandiflora,Caryophyllales,Portulacaceae,Dopaxanthin,,T,,Book Chapter,-,"Portulacaxanthin II,  Portulacaxanthin III",-,N,N
Investigating the Molecular Basis of Betalain Pigment Biosynthesis Using Two Parakeelya (Australian Calandrinia) Species,Hsiao-Hang Chung ,"Betalains are water soluble vacuolar plant pigments found only in 13 families of the order Caryophyllales. They are mutually exclusive of the common anthocyanins. Variation in the relative content of two betalain pigment subgroups, red-violet betacyanins and yellow betaxanthins, provides a range of vibrant colours in flowers, fruits and other organs. Due to tyrosine being the common precursor and only a few enzymes required for the production of the first coloured compounds, betalain biosynthesis is an attractive pathway for manipulation of flower colour. In theory, three key enzyme activities are required: (1) Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to synthesise DOPA from tyrosine; (2) DOPA 4,5-diooxygenase (DOD) to convert DOPA into betalamic acid, the principal chromophore of all betalains; and (3) DOPA oxidase (DO) to convert DOPA to cyclo-DOPA in the synthesis of betacyanins. However, only one key synthesis gene in the pathway, i.e. DOD, has been cloned and its expression has only been characterised in a few species. Furthermore, knowledge of the betalain biosynthesis pathway and its regulation is relatively scant compared to the other plant pigments. The aim of this study was to extend fundamental knowledge on betalain biosynthesis using two Australian native flowers, Parakeelya sp. Mt. Clere and P. balonensis, and to offer a characterised biological model for the genetic engineering of flower colour in the future. This project was comprised of three components: (1) Characterisation of betalain content and composition in both Parakeelya species, (2) Cloning and expression analysis of the DOPA 4,5-diooxygenase gene (DOD) in P. sp. Mt. Clere, and (3) Genetic and phenotypic characterisation of white flower mutants of P. balonensis. HPLC-LCMS revealed a simple betalain composition in petals of both Parakeelya species. P. sp. Mt. Clere has all the basic colours associated with betalain biosynthesis (i.e. violet, white, red and yellow) within a single flower. Violet petal sectors contained four betacyanins. The aglycone, betanidin, was the predominant pigment, followed in descending order of concentration by iso-betanidin, and the glycosylated derivatives betanin and iso-betanin. Four betaxanthins, dopaxanthin, portulacaxanthin II, vulgaxanthin I and vulgaxanthin II, were detected in yellow petal sectors. Red petal sectors contained a mixture of betacyanins and betaxanthins with the aglycones, betanidin and iso-betanidin, also the major betacyanins, and the betaxanthin composition was similar to the yellow petal sectors. The violet flowers of P. balonensis contained only betacyanin pigments, mostly betanidin and iso-betanidin, with betanin and iso-betanin as the minor pigments. Accumulation of the simplest betacyanin, betanidin, as a major pigment is not common in betalain containing plants. These findings have implications for both the chemotaxonomy of betalain containing plants throughout the world, and the evolution of betalain containing plants in Australia. The simple betalain composition in flowers of these Parakeelya species also represents a novel and simple system for studying betalain biosynthesis. In this study, two DOD gene homologues, PspDOD1 and PspDOD2, were cloned from the petals of P. sp. Mt. Clere. Both homologues showed high sequence identity to DOD genes in other betalain containing species. Transient expression using biolistic bombardment demonstrated that PspDOD1 confers betalain synthesis, whereas PspDOD2 did not. Gene expression analysis using qPCR showed that the level of PspDOD1 transcripts correlated with betalain accumulation during flower development, and in plant organs and coloured petal sectors, except white petal sectors. High PspDOD1 expression detected in non-pigmented white petal tissue suggests a regulatory mechanism involving the other gene/s in the pathway. Consistently low expression of PspDOD2 in all samples suggested that it has no role in betalain formation and so the function of this gene remains to be resolved. Genetic studies of 7 white flower mutant lines of P. balonensis indicated at least 3 non-allelic mutations are involved. In vivo and in vitro substrate (L-tyrosine and L-DOPA) feeding assays revealed the putative sites of these 3 mutant alleles. Mutant A had DOD and DO activity thus may be TH mutant or its transcription factor gene defect. Mutant B lacked DOD activity, thus possibly a DOD gene or transcription factor gene mutant. Mutant C lacked both DOD and DO activity and may be double mutant or a transcription factor mutant resulting in down regulation of both genes. This thesis entails the first betalain pigment analysis of an endemic Australian native plant genus, including two species, P. sp. Mt. Clere and P. balonensis. It characterises the betalain pigment composition and content, expression of a key synthetic gene, DOD, and genetic defects in white flower mutants. It contributes new knowledge towards understanding the evolution of betalain producing plants. A hypothetical model of betalain pigment synthesis in Parakeelya is also proposed. Together, the outcomes from this work provide the first steps to developing these species as model biological systems for investigating betalain biosynthetic pathways and its regulatory mechanisms, an essential step towards exploiting betalain pigments for genetic engineering of novel flower colours in the future.",-,Parakeelya mt. clere,Caryophyllales,Montiaceae,Dopaxanthin,,T,,Thesis-University of Queensland,-,"dopaxanthin, portulacaxanthin II, vulgaxanthin I and vulgaxanthin II",Petals,N,N
"Studies on Pigments from Fruits Of Rivina Humilis L.: Characterisation, Elicitation, Stability and Safety.","Imtiyaj Khan, Mohammad","This thesis work was conceived to carry out systematic studies towards introduction of an unexplored fruit into commercial mainstream as an alternative source of betalains. The aim of this thesis was to characterise pigments, enhance pigment accumulation, assess stability and safety of juice of ripened berries of Rivina humilis L. (Phytolaccaceae), commonly called as pigeon berry. Total betalains content was 0.35% fresh weight, and 1.7% dry weight. Notably, betaxanthins content was more than that of betacyanins. Ten betalains (two betacyanins and eight betaxanthins) were successfully identified viz. betanin, isobetanin, indicaxanthin, dopaxanthin, vulgaxanthin I, glutamine-betaxanthin, aspartic acid-betaxanthin, humilixanthin, tyrosine-betaxanthin and miraxanthin V based on their absorbance and mass spectral characteristics. Crude pigment extract was partially purified to betacyanins (70% pure, 23.5 mg/100 g fresh weight) and betaxanthins (95% pure, 6.1 mg/100 g fresh weight) fractions. In vitro antioxidant activity studies revealed EC50 against DPPH· (0.29, and 0.11 g/mL), and reducing power (2.8, and 1.3 g/mL) of betacyanins and betaxanthins, respectively. The activities were higher than that of gallic acid and ascorbic acid. Pigment rich crude extract and betacyanins did not exhibit in vitro cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell line, whereas betaxanthins exhibited cytotoxicity (IC50 12.0 g/mL) after the cells were exposed for 24 h. After 48 h of exposure, betacyanins and betaxanthins showed elevated cytotoxicity (IC50 17.5 and 2.0 g/mL, respectively). Nutritionally important metabolites of R. humilis berries from different developmental stages viz. early stage (green), intermediate (pink) and matured (red) were determined. Betalains accumulation increased exponentially during berry ontogeny, however, mRNA levels of a putative R. humilis betanidin-5-O-glucosyltransferase (RhBGT2) remained unchanged. Antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) relative expression decreased. The pattern in pigment increase suggested that, probably, betacyanins and betaxanthins are synthesised from the same pool of betalamic acid. In red berries, total carbohydrates (6.2 g), proteins (2.6 g), oil (0.7 g), phenols (105.7 mg gallic acid equivalent), niacin (5.3 mg), tocopherols (0.8 mg), and organic acids (196.7 mg) in 100 g fresh weight were determined. The extracted oil had fatty acid composition of 43% unsaturated and 18% polyunsaturated fats. Among the elements quantified, K content was the highest and Cu content was the lowest. Experiments were conducted to enhance betalains content in Rivina berries. It was observed that application of salicylic acid (0.1 mM) and chitosan (0.5%, w/v) to Rivina flowers resulted in significant (P < 0.05) increase (about 1.3-fold) in betalains content in berries, probably by inducing betalamic acid formation. Putative RhBGT2, SOD and CAT mRNA levels were not significantly affected by the treatments except that gene expression pattern of SOD was significantly (P < 0.01) reduced when chitosan level was increased to 1% ii (w/v). Ripened Rivina berry juice (RBJ) betalains were comparatively more stable at pH 5, low temperature (5C), and under nitrogen atmosphere in dark. RBJ betacyanins degraded upto 95% and 96% on treatment for 36 min at 90C, and storage for 48 days at 25C, respectively, whereas only 15% pigment was lost on storage at 5C over a period of 90 days. Presence of ascorbic acid protected RBJ betacyanins from degradation at 25C and 90C, whereas it did not show significant effect at 5C. During heating at 90C, Se4+ (upto 40 g/mL) had mild bleaching effect on RBJ betacyanins, whereas Zn2+ and Cu2+ (upto 40 g/mL) degraded 33% and 96% of the pigments, respectively, compared to control. Ascorbic acid protected the pigments from metal–induced bleaching and stabilising effect of ascorbic acid (0.25%, w/v) was significantly more than 0.5% ascorbic acid (w/v). Interestingly, presence of ascorbic acid (0.25%, w/v) along with Se4+ (40 g/mL) enhanced the halflife time of betacyanins at 90C by five–fold. Betaxanthins degraded rapidly in all the samples. Ascorbic acid (0.25%, w/v) with Se4+ (40 g/mL) regenerated betacyanins efficiently after thermal destruction, on storage at 5C. Samples containing both ascorbic acid (0.25%, w/v) and Se4+ (40 g/mL) produced an orange tinge resulting in the lowest values of colour parameters (Hunter’s Lab) compared to other samples, suggesting a possible complex formation, which was further supported by bathochromic shift in the max of betanin and isobetanin as determined by HPLC. To assess safety, RBJ was fed to adult male rats (singledose/acute: 1, 2 and 5 g RBJ/kg bw) and growing male rats (repeated dosing/subacute: 2.5 and 5 g RBJ/kg bw/d for 35 days; dietary feeding/subchronic: 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% RBJ in diet, w/w, for 90 days). In all the three feeding studies, RBJ was well tolerated and also, the feed intake, body and organ weights of RBJ administered groups were comparable to that of control rats. Data on hematology, histology of vital organs, biochemical measurements in serum and liver homogenates of RBJ treated rats were comparable to that of control in subacute and subchronic dietary studies. Rivina-banana spread, prepared to evaluate the feasibility of RBJ as colourant, quality parameters were not significantly affected and pigment retention was 68% after six months of cold storage. Thereafter, sensory analysis and consumer acceptability tests revealed that the product had good overall quality and was liked by consumers. From this thesis work, it could be concluded that R. humilis berry juice is likely to be a safe dietary source of a wide spectrum of betalain pigments, which could be 1) elicited in planta through salicylic acid and chitosan application, and 2) stabilised in vitro in presence of ascorbic acid (0.25%, w/v) along with Se4+ (40 g/mL).",-,Rivina Humilis,Caryophyllales,Phytolaccaceae,Dopaxanthin,,T,,"Thesis- University of Mysore, Quantification: mg/100g FW",,"betanin, isobetanin, indicaxanthin, vulgaxanthin I, glutamine-betaxanthin, aspartic acid-betaxanthin, humilixanthin, tyrosine-betaxanthin and miraxanthin V",Berries,Y,N

Mueller1 , Ursula Hinz1 , Murielle UzeÂ 2 , Christof Sautter2 , Jean-Pierre Zryd","3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) dioxygenase from Amanita muscaria catalyses the key reaction of betalain biosynthesis, namely the conversion of DOPA to betalamic acid by a 4,5-ring-opening reaction. In addition, it catalyses a 2,3 opening which yields the fungal pigment musca¯avin, a compound that has never been found in plants. In this work, a cDNA clone (DodA) encoding A. muscaria DOPA-dioxygenase was expressed in white Portulaca grandi¯ora petals, using the particle bombardment technique. Transformation resulted in the formation of yellow and violet spots that contained betalain pigments and musca¯avin, indicating that the fungal enzyme was expressed and active in plants, and could complement the plant betalain biosynthetic pathway.

"ANTHOCYANIN, THE NATURAL COLORANT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS IN HEALTH AND FOOD INDUSTRY: A SEARCH","Aswathy, J.M., Bosco Lawarence, Greesham Murukan and K. Murugan","Anthocyanins are unique plant pigments since they are critical for most of the red, purple and blue pigmentation of flowers, fruits and vegetables. Meanwhile, they are reactive in nature, anthocyanins degrade easily, or react with other compounds such as reactive metals such as iron, aluminum, and tin in the media, to form colorless or brown colored by products. Anthocyanins are glycosides of anthocyanidins (aglycones) andsugars. Anthocyanidins are almost always glycosylated in the 3-position, though glycosylation in other positions and in more than one position at a time is also encountered. Furthermore, the sugar moiety may be acylated with aliphatic or aromatic acids. Anthocyanidins are less in number but anthocyanins show much diversity offered by glycosylation and acylation. 635 anthocyanins were identified in nature, featuring six common aglycones and various types of glycosylations and acylations. Reports suggest that dietary consumption of anthocyanins is good for health. Based upon many cell-line studies, animal models, and human clinical trials, it has been suggested that anthocyanins possess anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activity, cardiovascular disease prevention, obesity control, and diabetes alleviation properties, all of which are more or less associated with their potent antioxidant property. Evidence suggests that absorption of anthocyanins occurs in the stomach and small intestine. Epithelial tissue uptake seems to be highly efficient, yet transportation into circulation, tissue distribution, and urine excretion are very limited. The bioactivity of bioavailable anthocyanins should be a focus of future research regarding their putative Health promoting effects.",Kongunadu Research Journal,Vitis vinifera,Vitales,Vitiaceae,Dopaxanthin,,T,,,"Aralia cordata, Aralia cordata, Fragaria anansa, Perilla frutescens, Daucus carota, Crocus sativus, Bixa Orellana Beta vulgaris","anthocyanin, crocin, carotenoid, bixin and norbixin betalain, betacyanin, betaxanthins ( portulaxanthinII and vulgaxanthin-I), muscaauri-VII,",Cell cultures,N,N

Ultrasound-assisted optimal extraction and thermal stability of betalains from colored quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd) hulls,"Cesar Laqui-Vilca, Silvana Aguilar-Tuesta, Wile Mamani-Navarro, Jose Montaño-Bustamante, Luis Condezo-Hoyos","Ultrasound-assisted extraction in water of betalains from selected colored quinoa hulls with specific colors was optimized by response surface methodology using a Box-Benhken design and then the thermal stability of these betalains was evaluated. Betacyanins from quinoa hulls were optimally extracted at amplitude = 70%, cycle = 0.6 and very short extraction time = 9.2 s, which produced 96.477 mg of betalains/100 g fresh weight of sample (FW). For quinoa hulls containing betaxanthins, an amplitude = 90%; cycle = 0.7 and extraction time = 40 s was required for the optimal extraction of pigments (201.01 mg of betalains/100 g FW).

Free amino compounds also take part in osmoregulation and play an important role in betaxanthin biosynthesis. In contrast to red beets, cactus pears offer a great palette of colour hues and therefore may be used as a food colouring free from certification.

"Characterization of betalains, saponins and antioxidant power in differently colored quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) varieties","Josefa Escribano, JuanaCabanes, Mercedes Jiménez-Atiénzar, MarthaI bañez-Tremolad, Luz Rayda Gómez-Pando, Francisco García-Carmona, Fernando Gandía-Herreroa","Quinoa was the traditional grain crop used by the prehispanic civilizations in America. Grains are white, black, yellow, and red-violet and plants are cultivated in vast areas of Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador. The recent description of the betacyanin pigment betanin in red-violet varieties is here further analyzed detecting the presence of amaranthin not previously identified in quinoa grains. Yellow-orange grains are characterized for the first time and up to four different betaxanthins are found to be responsible for this coloration. The native fluorescence of the identified betaxanthins makes the surface of the yellow quinoa grains glow with green fluorescent light. The presence of betalains is correlated with high antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities measured under the FRAP, ABTS and ORAC assays in grain extracts of 29 Peruvian varieties.

The cultures were grown in a flask containing 30 ml MS media fortified with 13.5 μM 2,4-D and 0.44 μM BAP. These cultures were elicited during its log-phase of growth using fungal elicitors (prepared from mycelia of Fusarium oxysporum), yeast extract, copper sulphate and cobalt chloride. The elicitation reduced the cell count, cell viability and percent pigmented cell in the suspension culture. Similarly, it also resulted in reduced betalain content by all the elicitors except 0.125 × 10−3% fungal elicitor. Rather, fungal elicitor at this concentration significantly enhanced the amaranthin, betanin, betalamic acid and betaxanthin content in the culture. Besides this, copper sulphate doubled the pigment contribution (ratio of particular pigment content to total pigment content) of betaxanthin at all the concentrations.

Quinoa,"B. Tanwar, A. Goyal, S. Irshaan, V.

Traditionally, quinoa seeds, on the basis of their color, are classified as red, black, and white or ivory. Nutritional composition of the quinoa grain varies with variety, climate, and other environmental factors. Phytonutrients and/or antinutrients are secondary metabolites categorized as having both beneficial and adverse health effects, depending upon the concentration in the dietary intake. The presence of bioactives, essential amino acids, higher amounts of vitamins and minerals, Ω‐3 fatty acids and the absence of gluten make quinoa suitable not only for those who cannot tolerate gluten, but also for the general population who are at risk of various chronic diseases. A number of studies have demonstrated that the consumption of quinoa might reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and menopausal disorders.",Whole Grains and Their Bioactives,Chenopodium quinoa,Caryophyllales,Amaranthaceae,Dopaxanthin,,T,,"Book; Quantification: mg/100g DW, connection to chemical listed in table",,"Oleanolic acid, hederagenin, phytolaccagenic acid, amaranthin, isoamaranthin, betanin, betacyanin, betaxanthin",grain,Y,N
Quinoa bitterness: causes and solutions for improving product acceptability,"Diego Suárez‐Estrella, Luisa Torri,  Maria Ambrogina Pagani, Alessandra Marti","Awareness of the several agronomic, environmental, and health benefits of quinoa has led to a constant increase in its production and consumption not only in South America, where it is a native crop, but also in Europe and the USA. However, producing wheat or gluten‐free based products enriched with quinoa alters some quality characteristics, including sensory acceptance. Several anti‐nutritional factors such as saponins are concentrated in the grain pericarp. These bitter and astringent substances may interfere with the digestion and absorption of various nutrients. Developing processes to decrease or modify the bitterness of quinoa can enhance palatability, and thus consumption, of quinoa. In addition to the production of sweet varieties of quinoa, other processes have been proposed. Some of them (i.e. washing, pearling and the combination of the two) have a direct effect on saponins, either by solubilization and/or the mechanical removal of seed layers. Others, such as fermentation or germination, are able to mask the bitterness with aroma compounds and/or sugar formation. This review presents the major sources of the undesirable sensory attributes of quinoa, including bitterness, and various ways of counteracting the negative characteristics of quinoa. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,Chenopodium quinoa,Caryophyllales,Amaranthaceae,Dopaxanthin,,T,,-,-,"Betacyanins, betaxanthins",grain,N,N

Bergenin has pharmacological actions such as chemopreventive and antihepatotoxic while menisdaurin has an anti-viral activity which needs its evaluation by an analytical method (UPLC-PDA method) that can be applied to the quality control of pharmaceutical preparations. The developed UPLC-PDA method was applied for identification and quantification of standards bergenin and menisdaurin in the methanol extract of F. virosa (FVME). The analysis was carried out using Eclipse C18 (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 µm) UPLC column. The optimized chromatographic condition was achieved at 0.16 mL/min flow rate using gradient system with acetonitrile and water as mobile phase. Both biomarkers were measured at λmax 235 nm in PDA detector at ambient temperature. The developed method furnished sharp and intense peaks of menisdaurin and bergenin at Rt = 2.723 and 3.068 min, respectively along with r2 > 0.99 for both. The recoveries of bergenin and menisdaurin were found in the range of 99.37–101.49% and 98.20–100.08%, respectively. With other validation data, including precision, specificity, accuracy, and robustness, this method demonstrated excellent reliability and sensitivity. The separation parameters i.e. retention, separation, and resolution factors for resolved standards (bergenin and menisdaurin) were >1, which showed good separation.

"Topical or oral treatment of peach flower extract attenuates UV-induced epidermal thickening, matrix metalloproteinase-13 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in hairless mice skin","Chung Shil Kwak,1 Jiwon Yang,1 Chang-Yup Shin,2,3,4 and Jin Ho Chung","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a major cause of skin photoaging. Previous studies reported that ethanol extract (PET) of Prunus persica (L.) Batsch flowers (PPF, peach flowers) and its subfractions, particularly the ethylacetate (PEA) and n-butanol extracts (PBT), have potent antioxidant activity and attenuate the UV-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in human skin cells. In this study, we investigated the protective activity of PPF extract against UV-induced photoaging in a mouse model.MATERIALS/METHODS Hairless mice were treated with PET or a mixture of PEA and PBT either topically or orally along with UV irradiation. Histological changes and biochemical alterations of mouse skin were examined. Major phenolic compounds in PPF extract were analyzed using an ACQUITY UPLC system. RESULTS The overall effects of topical and oral treatments with PPF extract on the UV-induced skin responses exhibited similar patterns. In both experiments, the mixture of PEA and PBT significantly inhibited the UV-induced skin and epidermal thickening, while PET inhibited only the UV-induced epidermal thickening. Treatment of PET or the mixture of PEA and PBT significantly inhibited the UV-induced MMP-13 expression, but not typeⅠ collagen expression. Topical treatment of the mixture of PEA and PBT with UV irradiation significantly elevated catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-peroxidase (GPx) activities in the skin compared to those in the UV irradiated control group, while oral treatment of the mixture of PEA and PBT or PET elevated only catalase and SOD activities, but not GPx. Thirteen phytochemical compounds including 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid, cimicifugic acid E and B, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside and kaempferol glycoside derivatives were identified in the PPF extract. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that treatment with PET or the mixture of PEA and PBT, both topically or orally, attenuates UV-induced photoaging via the cooperative interactions of phenolic components having anti-oxidative and collagen-protective activities.",Nutrition Research and Practice,Prunus persica,Rosales,Rosceae,Menisdaurin,,T,,Quantification: HPLC,-,"4-)-caffeoylquinic acid, cimicfugic acid E, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, multiflorin B, cimicfugic acid B",flowers,N,N

Mayer Æ Fred A. Mellon Anthony J. Michael Æ Arjan Narbad Æ Adrian J. Parr Keith W. Waldron Æ Nicholas J. Walton,"4-Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase (HCHL), a crotonase homologue of phenylpropanoid catabolism from Pseudomonas fluorescens strain AN103, led to the formation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde metabolites when expressed in hairy root cultures of Datura stramonium L. established by transformation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The principal new compounds observed were the glucoside and glucose ester of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, together with 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol-O-b-D-glucoside. In lines actively expressing HCHL, these together amounted to around 0.5% of tissue fresh mass. No protocatechuic derivatives were found, although a trace of vanillic acid-bD-glucoside was detected. There was no accumulation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehydes, whether free or in the form of their glucose conjugates. There was some evidence suggesting a diminished availability of feruloyl-CoA for the production of feruloyl putrescine and coniferyl alcohol.

Dichocarpum auriculatum (Franch.) W. T. Wang et P. K. Hsiao has the effect of clearing away heat, removing toxicity, and relieving swelling in southwestern China. Intriguingly, its root and whole herb also used as remedy for the neurological disease epilepsy. However, there are not any scientific reports on the phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of D. auriculatum. Aim of study: Traditional and folk medicinal knowledge would be useful for finding new pharmaceutical resources. There are many evidences over the years reported that an interaction probably exists between epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study was to investigate the potential AChE inhibitors and the phytochemical profiles of the specie D. auriculatum. Materials and methods: The AChE inhibitory activity of plant extracts of D. auriculatum and other 6 species from different regions of the genus Dichocarpum were evaluated in vitro assays and the UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technique was used to analyze the chemical constituents. Moreover, UPLC-ESI-MS/MS was used to determine the distribution of 12 standard compounds in samples. Results: As a preferred source of potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors of the genus Dichocarpum, D. auriculatum has been further investigated. The screening results show that the ability of root extracts from D. auriculatum (IC50 = 0.15 mg·mL-1) to inhibit AChE was better than other samples, it is consistent with traditional medicinal records. The phytochemical constituents of D. auriculatum was surveyed firstly by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis, and 36 compounds, including 14 alkaloids, 16 flavonoids, 6 others, were identified tentatively. Further experiments showed that five compounds (columbamine, palmatine, dauricine, jatrorrhizine and berberine) from D. auriculatum were confirmed the potential inhibition of AChE activity in vitro (IC50: 0.24–6.37 μM) and UPLC-ESI-MS/MS results showed that the content of most active compounds in roots was much higher than in aerial parts. Palmatine (IC50 = 0.34 μM) and columbamine (IC50 = 0.24 μM) showed prominent AChE inhibitory activity among the tested compounds. Conclusions: This is the first report about the evaluation of AChE inhibitory activity and phytochemical profiles of D. auriculatum, led to the identification of 36 compounds including alkaloids and flavonoids, and five alkaloids exhibited a significant AChE inhibitory activity and had the potential as AChE inhibitors.

Extraction of the plant materials using Soxhlet method with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and methanol afforded nine crude extracts. Fractionation and purification of the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of stem bark of B. rufescens yielded two new compounds identified as 4-(2′-hydroxyphenethyl)-5-methoxy-2-methylphenol and bauhiniside. Compounds identified as 6-methoxy-7-methyl-8-hydroxydibenz [b,f]oxepin, α-amyrin acetate, β-sitosterol 3-O-β-D-xylopyranoside, menisdaurin, sequoyitol, 6-hydroxy-7,7a-dihydrobenzofuran-2(6H)-one, glyceryl trilinoleate, linoleic acid, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were also isolated from the stem barks. The leaves extract yielded glyceryl trilinoleate, sequoyitol and bauhiniside. F. platyphylla yielded two new phenolic compounds from its methanolic extract which was identified as ficuside A and ficuside B. In addition, hordenine was isolated via alkaloid extraction, and also 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid anhydride, epicatechin, lupeol, lupeol acetate and α-amyrin acetate were identified from F. platyphylla. Bioactivities including antioxidant, antimicrobial, inhibitory studies on the brine shrimp larvae, tyrosinase, acetylcholinesterase and cyclooxygenase-2 were investigated. Among the nine crude extracts from the two plants, the methanol extract from the stem barks of B. rufescens showed a strong DPPH radical scavenging activity (14.31 µg/mL), and similar extract from F. platyphylla showed higher total phenolic content (719.58 µg GAE/mg), while the methanol extract from the leaves of B. rufescens showed the highest antioxidant value based on β-carotene bleaching assay (78.75%). The antimicrobial activity revealed the methanol extract from F. platyphylla was active against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (113 µg/mL) and a fungus, Aspergillus niger (56 µg/mL). Meanwhile, toxicity study indicated that, ethyl acetate from the leaves of B. rufescens was toxic against brine shrimp larvae (LC50 0.06 mg/mL). The methanol extract from F. platyphylla was found active against tyrosinase enzyme (49.2%). Evaluation of acetylcholinesterase inhibition using the microplate and bioautographic assays showed the methanol extract from F. platyphylla inhibited the enzyme activity with percent inhibition of 44.7% (LD 30.0 µg). In addition, among the isolated compounds, oxepin from the stem barks of B. rufescens was found to be active against Staphylococcus aureus (113 µg/mL) and lupeol acetate from F. platyphylla was found active against Candida glabrata (56 µg/mL). It was also found that, hordenine inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity at 58.6% (LD 33.0 µg).

Plant-derived antiviral drugs as novel hepatitis B virus inhibitors: Cell culture and molecular docking study,Mohammad K.ParvezMd.Tabish RehmanPerwezAlamMohammed S.Al-DosariSaleh I.AlqasoumiMohammed F.Alajmi,"Despite high anti-HBV efficacies, while the nucleoside analogs (e.g., lamivudine) lead to the emergence of drug-resistance, interferons (e.g., IFN-α causes adverse side-effects. Comparatively, various natural or plant products have shown similar or even better efficacy. Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural compounds. In this report, we have combined the in vitro cell culture and in silico molecular docking methods to assess the novel anti-HBV activity and delineate the inhibitory mechanism of selected plant-derived pure compounds of different classes. Of the tested (2.5-50 μg/ml) twelve non-cytotoxic compounds, ten (10 μg/ml) were found to maximally inhibit HBsAg production at day 5. Compared to quercetin (73%), baccatin III (71%), psoralen (67%), embelin (65%), menisdaurin (64%) and azadirachtin (62%) that showed high inhibition of HBeAg synthesis, lupeol (52%), rutin (47%), β-sitosterol (43%) and hesperidin (41%) had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. Further assessment of quercetin in combination with the highly active compounds, enhanced its anti-HBV activity up to 10%. Being the most important drug target, a 3-D structure of HBV polymerase (Pol/RT) was modeled and docked with the active compounds, including lamivudine as standard. Docking of lamivudine indicated strong interaction with the modeled HBV Pol active-site residues that formed stable complex (∆G = −5.2 kcal/mol). Similarly, all the docked antiviral compounds formed very stable complexes with HBV Pol (∆G = −6.1 to −9.3 kcal/mol).

Betaxanthin-Rich Extract from Cactus Pear Fruits as Yellow Water-Soluble Colorant with Potential Application in Foods,"Fernández-López, J.A., Roca, M.J., Angosto, J.M. et al. ","Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) fruit juice is a source of betaxanthin pigments which can be used as a natural yellow food colorant. The HPLC chromatographic pigment pattern corresponding to the betaxanthin-rich extract revealed the presence of four betaxanthins, of which indicaxanthin (proline-betaxanthin) accounts for around 85%. A betaxanthin-rich water-soluble food colorant from cactus pears fruits was produced by spray-drying microencapsulation using maltodextrin as a wall material. The resulting powder was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and its apparent color was analyzed by spectrometry. The stability of the microcapsules was examined at +20, +4 and −20 °C in the dark during six months of storage. The degradation of betaxanthins was delayed by microencapsulation and their colorant stability increased at lower temperatures. The potential application of the colorant microcapsules was successfully assessed in two food model systems: a yogurt and a soft-drink. Both foods presented an attractive pale yellow color. Pigment retention and color parameters were investigated during storage under controlled conditions. Slight changes in the pigment retention, in both model systems, pointed to excellent preservation in the dark, even after 28 days at 4 °C. However, the presence of light contributed to betaxanthin deterioration. Spray-drying microencapsulation succeeds in reducing volumen of the pigment extract and can be easy in storage and delivery of the powders. It is proved to be a suitable process that can be recommended for stabilizing betaxanthins from cactus pears to be used as water-soluble natural colorants in foods.",Plant Foods Hum Nutr,Opuntia ficus-indica,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Betaxanthins,,T,,,,,Fruit,Y,N

Biochemical Evaluation of the Decarboxylation and Decarboxylation-Deamination Activities of Plant Aromatic Amino Acid Decarboxylases,"Michael P. Torrens-Spence, Pingyang Liu, Haizhen Ding, Kim Harich, Glenda Gillaspy and Jianyong Li","Plant aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) enzymes are capable of catalyzing either decarboxylation or decarboxylation-deamination on various combinations of aromatic amino acid substrates. These two different activities result in the production of arylalkylamines and the formation of aromatic acetaldehydes, respectively. Variations in product formation enable individual enzymes to play different physiological functions. Despite these catalytic variations, arylalkylamine and aldehyde synthesizing AAADs are indistinguishable without protein expression and characterization. In this study, extensive biochemical characterization of plant AAADs was performed to identify residues responsible for differentiating decarboxylation AAADs from aldehyde synthase AAADs. Results demonstrated that a tyrosine residue located on a catalytic loop proximal to the active site of plant AAADs is primarily responsible for dictating typical decarboxylase activity, whereas a phenylalanine at the same position is primarily liable for aldehyde synthase activity. Mutagenesis of the active site phenylalanine to tyrosine in Arabidopsis thaliana and Petroselinum crispum aromatic acetaldehyde synthases primarily converts the enzymes activity from decarboxylation-deamination to decarboxylation. The mutation of the active site tyrosine to phenylalanine in the Catharanthus roseus and Papaver somniferum aromatic amino acid decarboxylases changes the enzymes decarboxylation activity to a primarily decarboxylation-deamination activity. Generation of these mutant enzymes enables the production of unusual AAAD enzyme products including indole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, and phenylethylamine. Our data indicates that the tyrosine and phenylalanine in the catalytic loop region could serve as a signature residue to reliably distinguish plant arylalkylamine and aldehyde synthesizing AAADs. Additionally, the resulting data enables further insights into the mechanistic roles of active site residues.",Journal of Biological Chemistry,Catharanthus roseus,Gentianales,Apocynaceae,4-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde,,T,,,"Papaver somniferum, Arabidopsis thaliana and Petroselinum crispum",,-,N,Y

The salidroside and tyrosol levels in the cell suspension cultures were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. High levels of salidroside and tyrosol were detected in cell suspension cultures of R. crenulata extracted with 75 % methanol, demonstrating that the biotechnological production of these compounds using plant cell suspension cultures derived from R. crenulata may be an attractive alternative to harvest-based production.","Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (PCTOC)",Rhodiola crenulata,Saxifragales,Crassulaceae,Tyrosol,,T,,,Rhodelia genus,,"Aseptic juvenile leaves, stems, roots",Y,Y

The ""shoot-clump"" culture in liquid medium was shown to be an appropriate method for the micropropagation of this bulbous plant. The complete process included three steps: 1. culture of ""twin-scales"" starting from the bulbs; 2. culture of the newly formed shoots in a medium for bud proliferation (Murashige Skoog + lmg 1-1 of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid + 5 mg 1-1 of benzyladenine), and 3. culture of ""shoot-clumps"" in a liquid-shake medium.

Twenty clones were initiated in 2003 from plants of different chemo-types and alkaloid contents obtained from the living collection of the Institute of Botany, Sofia. They were subcultured for 6 years under equal conditions on agar MS medium supplemented with BAP and NAA. The cultures kept the inherent alkaloid profiles and propagation coefficients of the mother plants. Galanthamine contents of the selected high-productive in vitro clones exceeded 1 mg/g DW and were comparable with those of the exploited Bulgarian populations of L. aestivum. However, dynamics in the biosynthetic activity were observed in all clones studied for at least 24 months. Different correlations were established between the dynamics of the main alkaloids galanthamine and lycorine, and the dry matter of the cultures of some clones and between clones. Secondary metabolic processes were stimulated by different means: elicitation with jasmonic acid, addition of alkaloid precursors in the medium, or musical treatment. However, the success of the biosynthetic stimulation was variable and depended on the course of the clone-specific dynamics during the period of treatment. The genotype was established as the crucially important factor for the biosynthetic capacity of the L. aestivum cultures, followed by the dynamics of the biosynthetic activity, and the application of external chemical or physical stimuli as modifications of the medium composition and consistence, and acoustic waves.",The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology,Leucojum aestivum,Asparagales,Amaryllidaceae,Galanthamine,,T,,Quantification: mg/g DW,-,,bulbs,Y,Y

Analysis of metabolic variation and galanthamine content in Narcissus bulbs by 1H NMR†,"Andrea Lubbe, Barbora Pomahačová, Young Hae Choi, Robert Verpoorte","Introduction – Galanthamine is a benzazepine alkaloid used as a drug to relieve symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. For pharmaceutical use this natural product has been extracted from the plant Leucojum aestivum (Amaryllidaceae) or produced synthetically. Limited supply of the natural source and high cost of synthetic production has led to a search for alternative sources of galanthamine. The bulbs of Narcissus pseudonarcissus (Amaryllidaceae) have been identified as a potential source of raw material for galanthamine extraction. Since inconsistent chemical composition can be an issue with medicinal plant material, it is of interest to know whether large variations occur between Narcissus bulbs grown in different geographical locations. Objective – To evaluate whether large differences exist in the overall metabolic profiles of Narcissus bulbs grown in the two most important cultivation regions. Methodology – 1H NMR and principal component analysis were used for an unbiased comparison of the bulb samples. Results – Overall metabolite profiles were quite similar, but galanthamine levels could slightly discriminate samples by geographical region. 1H NMR was used for quantitation of galanthamine, and was found to be comparable to quantitation by HPLC. Compared with conventional chromatographic methods, sample preparation for 1H NMR analysis is simple and rapid, and only a small amount of plant material is required. Conclusions – Since useful qualitative and quantitative information about the metabolic state of Narcissus bulbs can be obtained by 1H NMR, this method is useful for agricultural applications, and for quality control of raw material used in the pharmaceutical industry.",Phytochemical Analysis,Leucojum aestivm,Asparagales,Amaryllidaceae,Galanthamine,,T,,"Quantification: HNMR, HPLC",Narcissus pseudonarcissus,,bulbs,Y,Y

However, limited information is available on the mechanism of interaction between endophyte and plant. To investigate the effects of endophytic fungus ZPRs-R11, that is, Trimmatostroma sp., on salidroside and tyrosol accumulations in Rhodiola crenulata, signal transduction, enzyme gene expression, and metabolic pathway were investigated. Results showed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO), and salicylic acid (SA) involved in fungus-induced salidroside and tyrosol accumulations. NO acted as an upstream signal of H2O2 and SA. No up- or down-stream relationship was observed, but mutual coordination existed between H2O2 and SA. Rate-limiting enzyme genes with the maximum expression activities were UDP-glucosyltransferase, tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC), monoamine oxidase, phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), and cinnamic-4-hydroxylase sequentially. Nevertheless, the genes of tyrosine transaminase and pyruvate decarboxylase only indicated slightly higher activities than those in control. Thus, TYDC and PAL branches were the preferential pathways in ZPRs-R11-induced salidroside and tyrosol accumulation. Trimmatostroma sp. was a potential fungus for promoting salidroside and tyrosol accumulations.

Neither enzyme activity nor salidroside accumulation were detected in natural and transformed root cultures maintained in media without tyrosol. To induce TGase activity in biotransformation reactions, tyrosol was added to natural and transformed root cultures on the day of inoculation. The first peak of TGase activity (0.23 U/µg) was detected on day 9 in natural root culture, accompanied by the highest salidroside content (15.79 mg/g d.w.), but TGase activity was highest (0.27 U/µg) on day 15.

L-Phenylalanine (Phe) and trans-cinnamic acid (CA) were enzymatically transformed into the catechol portion of GAL. Herein, a Phe ammonia-lyase-encoding gene LrPAL3 and a cinnamate 4-hydroxylase-encoding gene LrC4H were cloned from Lycoris radiata, a GAL-producing plant. LrPAL3 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. LrPAL3 catalyzes the forward deamination conversion of L-Phe into trans-CA. The 3-chloro- and 4-fluoro-L-Phe were deaminated to generate the corresponding 3-chloro- and 4-fluoro-trans-CA by LrPAL3. LrPAL3-catalyzed reverse hydroamination was confirmed by the conversion of trans-CA into L-Phe with exceptional regio- and stereo-selectivity. LrC4H was overexpressed in E. coli with tCamCPR, a cytochrome P450 reductase-encoding gene. LrC4H catalyzes the regioselective para-hydroxylation on trans-CA to form p-coumaric acid. The transcriptional levels of both LrPAL3 and LrC4H were positively associated with the GAL contents within the leaves and flowers of L. radiata, which suggested that their expression and function are co-regulated and involved in the biosynthesis of GAL.

Effects of fungicides on galanthamine and metabolite profiles in Narcissus bulbs,"Andrea Lubbe, Robert Verpoorte, Young Hae Choi","Large-scale plant cultivation usually involves the use of pesticides. Apart from eliminating the target organism, the external chemicals may affect the metabolism of the crop plant. This may have implications for plants cultivated for specific medicinal compounds. In this study the effects of diverse fungicides on the metabolism of Narcissus pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton bulbs were investigated. N. pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton is being cultivated for the extraction of the alkaloid galanthamine. Fungicides typically used in Narcissus cultivation were applied in a field experiment. The aim was to determine whether fungicide applications changed the concentration of galanthamine in the bulbs. 1H NMR spectroscopy allowed quantitative analysis of galanthamine and other metabolites in bulb extracts. Multivariate data analysis revealed changes in bulb metabolite patterns caused by fungicides. Bulbs treated before planting generally had higher levels of alkaloids, while foliar field applications caused lower alkaloid levels but altered carbohydrate metabolism. Within these groups, certain fungicide treatments caused changes in specific metabolites. This study shows that the fungicides used in Narcissus cultivation can cause a change in the metabolome still detectable in the bulbs after harvest. The standard cultivation practices in terms of fungicide treatment were found suitable for the production of N. pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton as raw material for galanthamine extraction.

Alkaloids galanthamine, lycorine, tazettine, galanthine, galanthusine, demethylhomolycorine, and gemanthamine have been isolated and chemically characterized. The dynamics of galanthamine accumulation during vegetation has been studied. It is established that the content of galanthamine reaches maximum in bulbs at the end of the vegetation stage (except for L. aestivum, in which the maximum is reached at the beginning of vegetation). The bulbs should be harvested in the indicated vegetation periods.

Environmentally benign supercritical CO2 extraction of galanthamine from floricultural crop waste of Narcissus pseudonarcissus,"Orchidea Rachmaniah, Young Hae Choi, Inaki Arruabarrena, Bas Vermeulen, Jaap van Spronsend, Robert Verpoorte, Geert-Jan Witkamp","The influence of diverse factors on the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with supercritical CO2 (scCO2) of galanthamine from bulbs of Narcissus pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton was investigated. The parameters that were studied were CO2 density (temperature and pressure), flow rate and plant material particle size and pre-treatment. The highest yield (303 μg/g) was achieved by extracting 53–1000 μm particle-size powdered dried bulb material moistened with NH4OH (25%, v/v) at 70 °C, 220 bar (690 kg/m3) for 3 h. Other N. pseudonarcissus alkaloids such as O-methyllycorenine and haemanthamine were also obtained. N. pseudonarcissus alkaloids as free bases are highly soluble in CO2 at a high pH as opposed to the slightly soluble salt form in which they are generally found in plants. Therefore, plant material pre-treatment with a base is an essential step for galanthamine extraction. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results also revealed that the desorption of N. pseudonarcissus alkaloids from the plant material rather than the solubility of the alkaloids in the scCO2 plays a major role in this scCO2 extraction.

Analysis of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids from Narcissus by GC–MS and capillary electrophoresis,"R.Gotti ,J.Fiori, M.Bartolini, V.Cavrini","Amaryllidaceae are known as ornamental plants, furthermore some species of this family contain galanthamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and other alkaloids with interesting pharmacological activity. In the present work, the quali- and quantitative analysis of Amaryllidaceae-type alkaloids in the bulbs of Narcissus species is presented using different analytical approaches. Extracts of Narcissus pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton and Narcissus jonquilla Quail, were first examined by GC–MS using a Rtx®-5 MS (programmed temperature) and the major alkaloids were identified. Together with galanthamine, high contents of haemanthamine, were found. Galanthamine was reliably quantified by GC–MS, whereas haemanthamine partly decomposed under the GC conditions, thus alternative analytical methods were investigated. Firstly, reversed-phase HPLC–ESI-MS was applied to identify and isolate at semipreparative levels haemanthamine. The compound was fully characterized by MS/MS and 1H NMR and then used as a reference substance. The quantitation of both galanthamine and haemanthamine was then accomplished by capillary electrophoresis with spectrophotometric detection. A non-aqueous (NACE) approach was selected in order to use a running buffer fully compatible with samples in organic solvent. In particular, a mixture methanol–acetonitrile (75:25, v/v) containing ammonium acetate (90 mM) was used as a background electrolyte. The same analytical sample was subjected to GC–MS and NACE analysis; the different selectivity displayed by these techniques allowed different separation profiles that can be useful in phytochemical characterization of the extracts. The GC–MS and NACE methods were validated and applied to the quantitation of galanthamine (GC–MS and NACE) and haemanthamine (NACE) in bulbs of N. jonquilla.",Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis,Narcissus jonquilla,Asparagales,Amaryllidaceae,Galanthamine,,T,,"Quantification: GCMS, ug/100mg DW",Narcissus pseudonarcissus,,bulbs,Y,Y
Neuroprotective activity and acetylcholinesterase inhibition of five Amaryllidaceae species: A comparative study,"Natalie Cortes, Rafael Andrés Posada-Duque, Rafael Alvarez, Fernando Alzate, Strahil Berkov, Gloria Patricia, Cardona-Gómez, Edison Osorio","Amaryllidaceae alkaloids exhibit a wide range of physiological effects, of which the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity is the most relevant. However, scientific evidence related to their neuroprotective effectiveness against glutamate-induced toxicity has been lacking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative study of the neuroprotective activity and the AChE inhibitory activity of species of Amaryllidaceae. Main methods: The neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced toxicity was measured in rat cortical neurons and the Ellman method was employed for the quantification of acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of alkaloidal extracts of five species of Amaryllidaceae (Crinum jagus, Crinum bulbispermum, Hippeastrum barbatum, Hippeastrum puniceum and Zephyranthes carinata). The alkaloid Amaryllidaceae patterns based on GC/MS analyses were also investigated. Key findings: The results showed that the alkaloidal extract from C. jagus presented a high neuroprotective activity in both pre- and post-treatments against a glutamate excitotoxic stimulus. Furthermore, the alkaloid extracts from C. jagus and Z. carinata revealed an inhibitory activity of AChE from the electric eel with IC50 values of 18.28 ± 0.29 and 17.96 ± 1.22 μg/mL, respectively. In addition, 46 alkaloids were detected by GC/MS, and 20 of them were identified based on their mass spectra and retention index. The results suggest that the neuroprotective effects might be associated with lycorine and crinine-type alkaloids, whereas the acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibitory activity could be related to galanthamine and lycorine-type alkaloids, although not based on synergistic processes.

In order to discover new sources of potent AChE inhibitors, a combined strategy is presented based on AChE-inhibitory activity and chemical profiles by GC/MS, together with in silico studies. The combined strategy was applied on alkaloid extracts of five Amaryllidaceae species that grow in Colombia. Fifty-seven alkaloids were detected using GC/MS, and 21 of them were identified by comparing their mass-spectral fragmentation patterns with standard reference spectra in commercial and private library databases. The alkaloid extracts of Zephyranthes carinata exhibited a high level of inhibitory activity (IC50 = 5.97 ± 0.24 μg/mL). Molecular modeling, which was performed using the structures of some of the alkaloids present in this extract and the three-dimensional crystal structures of AChE derived from Torpedo californica, disclosed their binding configuration in the active site of this AChE. The results suggested that the alkaloids 3-epimacronine and lycoramine might be of interest for AChE inhibition.

Analysis of metabolic variation and galanthamine content in Narcissus bulbs by 1H NMR,"Andrea Lubbe, Barbora Pomahačová, Young Hae Choi, Robert Verpoorte","Introduction – Galanthamine is a benzazepine alkaloid used as a drug to relieve symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. For pharmaceutical use this natural product has been extracted from the plant Leucojum aestivum (Amaryllidaceae) or produced synthetically. Limited supply of the natural source and high cost of synthetic production has led to a search for alternative sources of galanthamine. The bulbs of Narcissus pseudonarcissus (Amaryllidaceae) have been identified as a potential source of raw material for galanthamine extraction. Since inconsistent chemical composition can be an issue with medicinal plant material, it is of interest to know whether large variations occur between Narcissus bulbs grown in different geographical locations. Objective – To evaluate whether large differences exist in the overall metabolic profiles of Narcissus bulbs grown in the two most important cultivation regions. Methodology – 1H NMR and principal component analysis were used for an unbiased comparison of the bulb samples. Results – Overall metabolite profiles were quite similar, but galanthamine levels could slightly discriminate samples by geographical region. 1H NMR was used for quantitation of galanthamine, and was found to be comparable to quantitation by HPLC. Compared with conventional chromatographic methods, sample preparation for 1H NMR analysis is simple and rapid, and only a small amount of plant material is required. Conclusions – Since useful qualitative and quantitative information about the metabolic state of Narcissus bulbs can be obtained by 1H NMR, this method is useful for agricultural applications, and for quality control of raw material used in the pharmaceutical industry.

CHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE BATIDACEAE* BETAXANTHINS AND THEIR SYSTEMATIC IMPLICATION,T. J. Mabry and B. L. Turner,"We wish to report that neither the red-violet plant pigments, the betacyanins (Mabry et al., 1962; 1963; 1964; Wyler et al., 1963) nor the co-existing but chemically un- characterized yellow pigments, the betaxanthins (Dreiding, 1961; Mabry, 1964) were detected in Batis maritima, one of the two species which comprise the family. B. maritima is a low shrubby, succulent bush found in the tropical and subtropical areas of America including particularly the coastal habitats of the southern United States. Another species, B. argillicola, has recently been described from New Guinea (Royen, 1958). The contro- versy regarding the taxonomic affinities of the Batidaceae is not resolved; however, the absence of the red-violet and yellow pigments, betacyanins, and betaxanthins, suggests that the family should not be included in the order Centrospermae. The taxonomic reliability of the betacyanins for delimiting the Centrospermae rests not only on their chemical uniqueness and restricted distribution but also because they are mutually exclusive with the widely occurring flavonoid pigments of higher plants, the anthocyanins. It was, therefore, recently suggested (Mabry et al., 1963) that the order Centrospermae (Chenopodiales) be reserved for the 10 betacyanin-containing families: Chenopodiaceae, Amaranthaceae. Phytolaccaceae, Stegnospermaceae (often treated as a subfamily of the Phytolaccaceae), Nyctaginaceae, Portulacaceae, Basell- aceae, Aizoaceae (excluding the Molluginaceae, which contains anthocyanins; Beck et al., 1962), Cactaceae, and Didieraceae. Little is known regarding the nature of the yellow substances called betaxanthins beyond the observations that they have distributional and electrophoretic properties similar to the betacyanins. At the present time, there is insufficient chemical evidence to support conclusively the interesting suggestion (Spragg, 1960; Dreiding, 1961; Mabry, 1964) that the betaxanthins may be structurally related to the betacyanins in a manner analogous to the chemical relationship of the yellow flavones and flavonols to the anthocyanin",Taxon,Batis maritima,Brassicales,Bataceae,Betaxanthins,,F,"""not detected""",,B. argillicola,,,N,Y
Betaxanthins as pigments responsible for visible fluorescence in flowers,"Fernando Gandı ́a-Herrero, Josefa Escribano, Francisco Garcı ́a-Carmona","Betalains are water-soluble nitrogen-containing pigments present in flowers and fruits of plants of the order Caryophyllales, where they replace anthocyanins. This article describes how flowers containing yellow betaxanthins are fluorescent. Betaxanthins exhibit spectra with excitation maxima between 463 nm and 474 nm and emission maxima between 509 nm and 512 nm. Thus, betaxanthins are able to absorb blue light and emit green light. Relations between fluorescence and the structural properties of the pigments are discussed. For the first time, pictures of flowers naturally emitting light are presented. Yellow flowers of the ornamental plant Portulaca grandiflora were chosen as a model for the studies in fluorescence due to the existence of the white phenotype, which was used as a control.

However,certain families within the order Caryophyllales produce another class of pigments, the betalains, instead ofanthocyanins. The occurrence of betalains and anthocyanins is mutually exclusive. Betalains are divided into twoclasses, the betaxanthins and betacyanins, which produce yellow to orange or violet colours, respectively. In thisarticle we show betalain production in species that normally produce anthocyanins, through a combination ofgenetic modification and substrate feeding.Results:The biolistic introduction of DNA constructs for transient overexpression of two differentdihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) dioxygenases (DODs), and feeding of DOD substrate (L-DOPA), was sufficient toinduce betalain production in cell cultures ofSolanum tuberosum(potato) and petals ofAntirrhinum majus. HPLCanalysis showed both betaxanthins and betacyanins were produced. Multi-cell foci with yellow, orange and/or redcolours occurred, with either a fungal DOD (fromAmanita muscaria) or a plant DOD (fromPortulaca grandiflora),and the yellow/orange foci showed green autofluorescence characteristic of betaxanthins. Stably transformedArabidopsis thaliana(arabidopsis) lines containing35S: AmDODproduced yellow colouration in flowers and orange-red colouration in seedlings when fed L-DOPA. These tissues also showed green autofluorescence. HPLC analysis ofthe transgenic seedlings fed L-DOPA confirmed betaxanthin production.Conclusions:The fact that the introduction of DOD along with a supply of its substrate (L-DOPA) was sufficient toinduce betacyanin production reveals the presence of a background enzyme, possibly a tyrosinase, that canconvert L-DOPA tocyclo-DOPA (or dopaxanthin to betacyanin) in at least some anthocyanin-producing plants. Theplants also demonstrate that betalains can accumulate in anthocyanin-producing species. Thus, introduction of aDOD and an enzyme capable of converting tyrosine to L-DOPA should be sufficient to confer both betaxanthinand betacyanin production to anthocyanin-producing species. The requirement for few novel biosynthetic stepsmay have assisted in the evolution of the betalain biosynthetic pathway in the Caryophyllales, and facilitatedmultiple origins of the pathway in this order and in fungi. The stably transformed35S: AmDODarabidopsis plantsprovide material to study, for the first time, the physiological effects of having both betalains and anthocyanins inthe same plant tissues.",BMC Plant Biology,Solanum tuberosum,Solanales,Solanaceae,Betaxanthins,,T,,,Antirrhinum majus,,cell cultures ofSolanum tuberosum(potato) and petals ofAntirrhinum majus,Y,Y

An Approach to the Role of Tyrosinase in the Biosynthetic Pathway of Betalains,"Fernando Gandía-Herrero, Josefa Escribano, Francisco García-Carmona","Tyrosinase or polyphenol oxidase (EC 1.14.18.1) is the key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis and in the enzymatic browning of fruits and vegetables. The role of tyrosinase in the secondary metabolism of plants still remains unclear, but its implication in betalain biosynthesis has been proposed. Betalains are an important class of water-soluble pigments, characteristic of plants belonging to the order Caryophyllales. In this article, the betaxanthins, tyrosine-betaxanthin (portulacaxanthin II) and dopaxanthin, are reported to be physiological substrates for tyrosinase. The direct activity of tyrosinase on selected betaxanthins is characterized in depth, and conversion of tyrosine-betaxanthin to dopaxanthin and its further oxidation to a series of compounds are described. Identity of the reaction products was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Masses determined for the reaction products were the same in all cases, 389 m/z ([M + H]+) and equal to that determined for betanidin. Data indicate that dopaxanthin-quinone is obtained and evolves to more stable species by intramolecular cyclization. Kinetic parameters for tyrosinase acting on dopaxanthin were evaluated, showing a high affinity for this substrate (Km = 84.3 μm). The biosynthetic scheme of betalains is reviewed and a branch is proposed based on the description of physiological substrates for tyrosinase.

Betaxanthins as pigments responsible for visible fluorescence in flowers,"Fernando Gandía-Herrero, Josefa Escribano & Francisco García-Carmona","Betalains are water-soluble nitrogen-containing pigments present in flowers and fruits of plants of the order Caryophyllales, where they replace anthocyanins. This article describes how flowers containing yellow betaxanthins are fluorescent. Betaxanthins exhibit spectra with excitation maxima between 463 nm and 474 nm and emission maxima between 509 nm and 512 nm. Thus, betaxanthins are able to absorb blue light and emit green light. Relations between fluorescence and the structural properties of the pigments are discussed. For the first time, pictures of flowers naturally emitting light are presented. Yellow flowers of the ornamental plant Portulaca grandiflora were chosen as a model for the studies in fluorescence due to the existence of the white phenotype, which was used as a control.

Genetic engineering of shikonin biosynthesis hairy root cultures of Lithospermum erythrorhizon transformed with the bacterial ubiC gene,"Susanne Sommer1, Annegret Köhle1, Kazufumi Yazaki2, Koichiro Shimomura3, Andreas Bechthold1 and Lutz Heide","The biosynthetic pathway to 4-hydroxybenzoate (4HB), a precursor of the naphthoquinone pigment shikonin, was modified in Lithospermum erythrorhizon hairy root cultures by introduction of the bacterial gene ubiC. This gene of Escherichia coli encodes chorismate pyruvate-lyase (CPL), an enzyme that converts chorismate into 4HB and is not normally present in plants. The ubiC gene was fused to the sequence for a chloroplast transit peptide and placed under control of a constitutive plant promoter. This construct was introduced into L. erythrorhizon by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation. The resulting hairy root cultures showed high CPL activity. 4HB produced by the CPL reaction was utilized for shikonin biosynthesis, as shown by in vivo inhibition of the native pathway to 4HB with 2- aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid (AIP), an inhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. A feeding experiment with [1,7-13C2]shikimate showed that in the absence of AIP the artificially introduced CPL reaction contributed ca. 20% of the overall 4HB biosynthesis in the transgenic cultures. ubiC transformation did not lead to a statistically significant increase of shikonin formation, but to a 5-fold increase of the accumulation of menisdaurin, a nitrile glucoside which is presumably related to aromatic amino acid metabolism.",Plant Molecular Biology,Lithospermum erythrorhizon,Boraginales,Boraginaceae,Menisdaurin,,T,,"Quantification: HPLC, umol/g",-,4-hydroxybenzoic acid,hairy Root Cultures,Y,Y

Betaxanthin pattern of hairy roots from Beta vulgaris var. lutea and its alteration by feeding of amino acids,"Jürg Hempel, Hartmut Böhm","Betaxanthins from hairy root cultures of Beta vulgaris var. lutea showed two predominating substances, portulaxanthin II and vulgaxanthin I, and several minor components in HPLC profiles. The presence of muscaaurin VII, indicaxanthin, dopaxanthin, vulgaxanthin II, III and IV were suggested, the latter two as new natural compounds.

These betaxanthins structurally corresponded to the substances applied, except of that from glutamic acid. It was vulgaxanthin I instead of vulgaxanthin II and might be formed due to the function of glutamine synthetase. Also, the d-isomers of amino acids were incorporated into corresponding betaxanthins not only by hairy root cultures but also by seedlings of B. vulgaris var. lutea.

A novel method using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection for the determination of betaxanthins,"Fernando Gandía-Herrero, Francisco García-Carmona, Josefa Escribano","Betaxanthins are natural water-soluble yellow pigments present in plants of the order Caryophyllales. The native fluorescence of these compounds is extensively characterized in this work, with study of the fluorescent properties of 14 different betaxanthins. All the species showed a similar behavior, with excitation maxima between 463 and 475 nm and emission maxima between 506 and 515 nm. Thus, betaxanthins absorb light corresponding to the blue color and emit visible green light. Similarities in excitation and emission spectra point to the responsibility of betalamic acid in fluorescence. The influence of the amine moiety is discussed. For the first time fluorescent properties of betaxanthins are applied to the detection of these pigments after separation by high-performance liquid chromatography. Wavelengths used were 460 nm for excitation and 510 nm for emission, which were suitable for detecting the native fluorescence of all the pigments assayed. Calibration was performed in each case and it exhibited linearity within the range considered, at least 20 μM. The lowest detection limit was 100 nM, corresponding to betaxanthins derived from methionine sulfoxide and leucine.

Betalain production is possible in anthocyanin-producing plant species given the presence of DOPA-dioxygenase and L-DOPA,"Harris, N.N., Javellana, J., Davies, K.M. et al","Background
Carotenoids and anthocyanins are the predominant non-chlorophyll pigments in plants. However, certain families within the order Caryophyllales produce another class of pigments, the betalains, instead of anthocyanins. The occurrence of betalains and anthocyanins is mutually exclusive. Betalains are divided into two classes, the betaxanthins and betacyanins, which produce yellow to orange or violet colours, respectively. In this article we show betalain production in species that normally produce anthocyanins, through a combination of genetic modification and substrate feeding.
 Results
 
 The biolistic introduction of DNA constructs for transient overexpression of two different dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) dioxygenases (DODs), and feeding of DOD substrate (L-DOPA), was sufficient to induce betalain production in cell cultures of Solanum tuberosum (potato) and petals of Antirrhinum majus. HPLC analysis showed both betaxanthins and betacyanins were produced. Multi-cell foci with yellow, orange and/or red colours occurred, with either a fungal DOD (from Amanita muscaria) or a plant DOD (from Portulaca grandiflora), and the yellow/orange foci showed green autofluorescence characteristic of betaxanthins. Stably transformed Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) lines containing 35S: AmDOD produced yellow colouration in flowers and orange-red colouration in seedlings when fed L-DOPA. These tissues also showed green autofluorescence. HPLC analysis of the transgenic seedlings fed L-DOPA confirmed betaxanthin production.
 Conclusions
 
 The fact that the introduction of DOD along with a supply of its substrate (L-DOPA) was sufficient to induce betacyanin production reveals the presence of a background enzyme, possibly a tyrosinase, that can convert L-DOPA to cyclo-DOPA (or dopaxanthin to betacyanin) in at least some anthocyanin-producing plants. The plants also demonstrate that betalains can accumulate in anthocyanin-producing species. Thus, introduction of a DOD and an enzyme capable of converting tyrosine to L-DOPA should be sufficient to confer both betaxanthin and betacyanin production to anthocyanin-producing species. The requirement for few novel biosynthetic steps may have assisted in the evolution of the betalain biosynthetic pathway in the Caryophyllales, and facilitated multiple origins of the pathway in this order and in fungi. The stably transformed 35S: AmDOD arabidopsis plants provide material to study, for the first time, the physiological effects of having both betalains and anthocyanins in the same plant tissues.",BMC Plant Biol,Solanum tuberosum,Solanales,Solanaceae,Betaxanthins,,T,,,Y,,"cell cultures,  biolistic introduction of DNA constructs for transient overexpression of two different dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) dioxygenases (DODs), and feeding of DOD substrate (L-DOPA)",Y,Y

Screening bioactive compounds with multi-‚Äãtargets from Rhodiola crenulata by a single column containing co-‚Äãimmobilized beta2-‚Äãadrenergic receptor and voltage dependent anion channel isoform 1,"Liu, Ting; Hou, Yani; Liu, Jiajun; Li, Qian; Wang, Jing; Liang, Yuan; Bian, Liujiao; Zhao, Xinfeng","The pursuit of drugs having improved therapeutic efficacy necessitates increasing research on new assays for screening bioactive compounds. with multi-‚Äãtargets. This work synthesized a chromatog. stationary phase contg. co-‚Äãimmobilized beta2-‚Äãadrenergic receptor (Œ≤2-‚ÄãAR) and voltage dependent anion channel isoform 1 (VDAC-‚Äã1) to achieve such purpose. Specific ligands of the two receptors (e.g. salbutamol, methoxyphenamine, ATP and NADH) were utilized to characterize the specificity and bioactivity of the column. Validated application of the stationary phase was performed by screening multi-‚Äãtarget compds. of Rhodiola crenulata using high performance affinity chromatog. coupled with ESI-‚ÄãQ-‚ÄãTOF-‚ÄãMS. By zonal elution, we identified salidroside as a bioactive compd. simultaneously binding to Œ≤2-‚ÄãAR and VDAC-‚Äã1. The compd. exhibited the binding sites of 1.0 √ó 10-‚Äã7 and 4.0 √ó 10-‚Äã7 M on the Œ≤2-‚ÄãAR and VDAC-‚Äã1. On these sites, the assocn. consts. were calcd. to be 3.3 √ó 104 and 1.0 √ó 104 M-‚Äã1. Mol. docking indicated that the binding of salidroside to the two receptors occurred on Ser169 and Phe255of Œ≤2-‚ÄãAR, and the channel wall of VDAC-‚Äã1. Taking together, we concluded that the column contg. co-‚Äãimmobilized receptors has potential for screening bioactive compounds. with multi-‚Äãtargets from complex matrices including traditional Chinese medicines.",,Rhodiola_crenulata,Saxifragales,Crassulaceae,Salidroside,,T,,,None,,,Y,
